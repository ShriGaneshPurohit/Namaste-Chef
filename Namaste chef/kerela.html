 RECIPE: 
 


  <p> <hr>
    Soaking Chana Dal
    Rinse chana dal for a couple of times in water. 
    Soak the lentils in 1 cup water for 2 hours.
    Drain the soaked lentils very well. There should be no water in the soaked dal. <hr>
    Making Dal Vada Mixture
    Then add the soaked lentils in a mixer-grinder or blender.
    Without adding any water, grind to a coarse mixture. Some whole chana dal should be there in the mixture. I have not added any water, while grinding. 
    If you add water, then it becomes difficult to shape them. If you are not able to grind at all, then add 1 to 2 tablespoons water. <hr>
    Now take the coarsely ground chana dal in a bowl. 
    Add chopped onions, green chilies, curry leaves and chopped coriander leaves. You can also add chopped ginger.
    Season with salt. Mix very well. Check the taste and add more salt if needed. <hr>
    Now make small or medium sized balls from the mixture.
    Flatten them and place them on a plate or tray.
    You can use a banana leaf or plastic sheet or a ziplock bag to place the shaped vada. <hr>
    Frying Parippu Vada
    Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan on medium heat.
    Check the oil temperature by dropping a small portion of the batter in the oil. If it comes up steadily & quickly, the oil is hot enough for frying.
    Now carefully slid the prepared dal vada in the hot oil. <hr>
    Fry them for a couple of minutes and then turn over with a slotted spoon and fry the other side. Lower the flame while frying if the oil becomes too hot.
    Fry till they become golden and crisp. When the onions on the crust of the vada, look golden, this means the dal vada is done.
    Place them on kitchen paper towels to get rid of extra oil.
    Fry the remaining dal vada this way in batches.
    Serve the dal vada hot with coconut chutney or tomato ketchup. <hr>

Making Red Coconut Chutney
Take the tightly packed grated coconut, chopped shallots or pearl onions, dried red chilies and ginger in a chutney grinder or small blender.
Add salt as required and water.
Grind or blend to a fine consistency. <hr>
Note that, if you want to tone down the raw taste of red chilies, then just roast them lightly in a pan.
You can also sauté them in a bit of coconut oil. Apart from ginger, you can also add 1 to 2 cloves of peeled garlic.
Transfer the ground red coconut chutney in a small steel bowl or pan and set aside. <hr>
Making Tempering
Heat coconut oil in a small pan.
Add mustard seeds and allow them to crackle on low heat. <hr>
Then add the urad dal.
Fry the urad dal on low heat stirring often, till they are a maroonish golden.
Add the curry leaves and chopped shallots or pearl onions.
On a low heat, sauté stirring often till the shallots are light golden. <hr>
Next add the tempering mixture along with its oil to the red coconut chutney kept in the bowl.
Stir and mix well to combine.
Serve the Kerala style Red Coconut Chutney with idli, dosa, medu vada or uttapam.

    Making Vada Batter
    Rinse urad dal a couple of times in fresh water. Then soak the lentils for 4 hours or overnight.
    Grind or blend the soaked lentils to a smooth batter with water.
    If the batter becomes watery, then the instant relief would be to add some semolina or urad dal flour or rice flour to it.
    Add all the spices, herbs and salt. Mix <hr>
    Take a bowl of water. Apply some water from the bowl on both your palms. Take some batter in your right hand from the bowl. Give it a round shape by moving it around.
    With your thumb make a hole in the center. You can also use banana leaves or zip lock bags to give the medu vada its doughnut shape.
    Frying Medu Vada
    In a kadai (wok) or pan heat oil for deep frying. Keep the heat to medium. <hr>
    Once the oil becomes hot, slid the vada gently and carefully into the hot oil.
    Shape the batter this way and gently slid them in the oil. Don’t overcrowd the kadai or pan with the vada.
    Once the vada is slightly golden then gently turn over with a slotted spoon and continue to <hr>
    Fry them till crisp and golden. The oil should be not very hot, but medium hot. You want the vadas to be cooked from inside. Very hot oil will quickly brown the vadas from outside but they will remain uncooked from inside. Less hot oil will make the medu vada to absorb too much oil. Even if the batter is thin then also the medu vadas will absorb too much oil.
    Fry all the medu vada this way till they become evenly browned and crisp.
    Drain them on kitchen tissue to remove excess <hr>
    Serve the medhu vadai, hot or warm with sambar and coconut chutney. It can also be served with other dips like mint chutney, coriander chutney, tomato sauce or onion chutney, tomato chutney etc.
    One of the best combination is sambar vada where these medu vadai are dunked in piping hot sambar and served with a side of coconut chutney. This vada sambar meal is finished with steaming hot filter coffee.

 RECIPE: 
 


  <p> <hr>
    Marinate The Fish
    Rinse fish steaks well with water and drain well.
    Mix together turmeric powder, lime juice, black pepper powder, and salt on a large plate.
    Add the fish to the plate and coat well with the spices. Keep aside to marinate for 30 minutes.
    Fry The Fish <hr>
    Heat coconut oil in a large pan over medium-high heat.
    Once the oil is hot, arrange the fish in a single layer and fry for 3-4 minutes on each side until lightly browned.
    Transfer the fried fish to a plate and keep it aside. <hr>
    Make The Curry
    To the remaining oil in the pan, add cloves, green cardamoms, cinnamon, mustard seeds, curry leaves, and green chilies, and fry for 3-4 seconds.
    Add onions, ginger, and garlic and fry till onions turn pinkish.
    Add coriander powder, turmeric powder, salt, and black pepper powder, and cook for 8-10 seconds.
    Reduce the heat to low. <hr>
    Now add thin coconut milk and tomato and cook for 20-30 seconds.
    Add 1 cup of water and mix well. Add the fish pieces back to the pan and shake the pan to coat them with the curry.
    Cover the pan and cook the curry for 10 minutes, shaking the pan a few times in between. <hr>
    Finally, add thick coconut milk, tamarind paste, and garam masala and mix well. Cook on low heat until the curry comes to a gentle simmer.
    Do not overcook otherwise the curry may split.
